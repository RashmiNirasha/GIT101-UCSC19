## Learnings/Feedbacks on the Session (Session on Git 101)
I had the opportunity to attend a session on Intro to GitHub specifically designed for second-year undergraduates at UCSC. The session was focused on providing insights and guidance for our second-year group project. It proved to be extremely informative and beneficial for our project development. 

Throughout the session, we gained a comprehensive understanding of version control and its significance in collaborative software development. We learned how to create new repositories on GitHub and initialize them to manage our project efficiently. The session covered essential Git commands such as `clone`, `add`, `commit`, `push`, and `pull`, which proved to be invaluable for our team's workflow.

Additionally, the session emphasized the concept of branching and its importance in collaborative development. We learned how to create branches, merge changes, and resolve any conflicts that arise. This knowledge proved vital as we work together on our second-year group project.

Moreover, we explored the pull request workflow and the code review process on GitHub, enabling us to engage in effective collaboration and receive constructive feedback. We also gained insights into managing project history effectively, ensuring traceability and accountability for our work.

Overall, the session catered specifically to the needs of second-year undergraduates at UCSC, focusing on our 2nd year group project. It equipped us with the necessary skills and knowledge to utilize GitHub for successful collaboration and project management. I am grateful to the MLSA team for organizing such a valuable and targeted session.
